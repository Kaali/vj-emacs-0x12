* Intro

Emacs configuration for year 2018. My [[https://github.com/Kaali/vj-emacs-0f][2015]] configuration has served me
well. But it's time for a new configuration with a bit of a cleanup.

Some of the experimental packages are now stable, and some ended up
being unsused. Main changes are:

1. Simplify package management
2. Switch from [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] to [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]]

* Installation

Keep it simple. Clone as .emacs.d and done.
